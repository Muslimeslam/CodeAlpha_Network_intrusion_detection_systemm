How to Run Suricata on Kali Linux
Suricata is a powerful open-source network intrusion detection system (NIDS) that monitors network traffic for suspicious activities. This guide walks you through installing, configuring, and running Suricata on Kali Linux.

Prerequisites
A system running Kali Linux.
Sudo or root privileges.
Basic understanding of network interfaces and protocols.
Installation
Step 1: Update Your System
bash
Copy code
sudo apt update && sudo apt upgrade -y
Step 2: Install Suricata
bash
Copy code
sudo apt install suricata -y
Step 3: Verify Installation
Check the version to ensure Suricata is installed correctly:

bash
Copy code
suricata --version
Configuration
Step 1: Identify Your Network Interface
Determine the network interface to monitor using:

bash
Copy code
ip addr
For example, eth0, wlan0, or any active interface.

Step 2: Configure Suricata
The main configuration file is located at:

plaintext
Copy code
/etc/suricata/suricata.yaml
You can edit it with any text editor, such as nano:

bash
Copy code
sudo nano /etc/suricata/suricata.yaml
Set the HOME_NET variable to represent your internal network. Example:

yaml
Copy code
HOME_NET: "[192.168.0.0/24]"
Step 3: Add Custom Rules
Suricata rules are located in:

plaintext
Copy code
/etc/suricata/rules/
You can create a custom rule file:

bash
Copy code
sudo nano /etc/suricata/rules/custom.rules
Example rules:

plaintext
Copy code
alert icmp any any -> $HOME_NET any (msg:"ICMP Ping Request Detected"; sid:100001; rev:1;)
alert tcp $HOME_NET any -> any 21 (msg:"FTP Control Connection Detected"; sid:100002; rev:1;)
alert tcp any any -> $HOME_NET 80 (msg:"Inbound HTTP Traffic Detected"; sid:100003; rev:1;)
alert tcp $HOME_NET any -> any 25 (msg:"SMTP Traffic Detected"; sid:100004; rev:1;)
Update the suricata.yaml file to include the custom rules file:

yaml
Copy code
rule-files:
  - custom.rules
Running Suricata
Step 1: Test the Configuration
Validate your Suricata configuration:

bash
Copy code
sudo suricata -T -c /etc/suricata/suricata.yaml -v
Step 2: Start Suricata in Live Mode
Run Suricata to monitor traffic on your chosen interface:

bash
Copy code
sudo suricata -c /etc/suricata/suricata.yaml -i <network-interface>
Replace <network-interface> with the appropriate interface, e.g., eth0 or wlan0.

Step 3: Monitor Logs
Suricata logs and alerts are stored in:

plaintext
Copy code
/var/log/suricata/
To view alerts:

bash
Copy code
sudo tail -f /var/log/suricata/fast.log
Testing Suricata
Generate test traffic to verify detection:

Ping Test:

bash
Copy code
ping -c 4 <target-ip>
Check the logs for ICMP alerts.

FTP Test:
Use an FTP client to connect to an FTP server.

HTTP Test:
Access a website using a browser or curl.

SMTP Test:
Send an email through an SMTP server (if available).

Stopping Suricata
To stop Suricata, press Ctrl+C in the terminal where it is running. Alternatively, if running as a service:

bash
Copy code
sudo systemctl stop suricata
